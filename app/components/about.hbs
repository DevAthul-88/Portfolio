  <p class='subtitle mt-4 w pop'>
    I am a self-taught full-stack developer from India. I like to build fully
    responsive websites with high-quality UI and UX. When I am building a
    product I will make sure that the customers get satisfied with their needs
    and want.

  <p class='subtitle mt-4 w pop'>
    Time back almost 3 years ago when I saw a website with several animations
    and eye-catching colours that website inspired me so much. I wondered how
    these things were built how it works. So I started learning the basics of
    HTML and CSS. I built some basic UI and cloned some famous websites to learn
    web design. Then I moved into JavaScript learned the basics of it and moved
    to advance JS concepts. After I felt comfortable with JS I started learning
    Node.JS then Express.Js with handlebars and MongoDb I built an eCommerce web
    app after building that I felt so Proud of myself. Then I learned several
    JavaScript technologies. And now I can proudly say that I am a full stack
    developer. My job is converting normal users into engaged customers
